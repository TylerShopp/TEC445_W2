I **really** struggled with Gitbash for a few days, I was trying to:
>Add an animated gif of a dog to my repo

>said gif was to be linked from a url-

>I was not able to get it to appear in my repo-

>I fear I changed a setting that is preventing it from working-

>I delete my first repo, and try to make a new one - nothing works and it keeps referencing old repo name when trying to push-

>Panic insues

**So,** Sunday evening with a *few* hours left before my assignment is **due** I have a breakthrough-

>I WAS USING THE ORIGINAL LOCAL FOLDER FROM THE FIRST REPO.

>Create new folder, and we are back in action!

**IT WORKS!!**

>I am not sure what I did differently but we now have a cool dog gif in the repo
